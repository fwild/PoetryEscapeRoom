What if I said someone who loves you very much is watching over you? 
What if I said someone with your best interests at heart is listening to you breathe? 
The world is going on without you- the version of yourself you know the best. 
But here’s a whole world that can’t continue without you. 
When you look at the world, with its stark black and white division, don’t you wonder about the people who lived before, don’t you wonder about the ones for whom dreaming and waking were on the same continuum? 
Don’t you wonder about the thousands of other logics at play in your head? 
Where do they come from? Where do they get their colours? 
Which world, at the end of the day, do you trust? The one before your eyes or the one behind your eyes? 
If I said someone with only love for you was listening to you speak as you dream, what would you say? 
What would you sleep talk about? 
Things that bother you? 
Things you feel are disappearing or crumbling or vanishing, or things that are appearing, things that won’t vanish or disappear as all things rightly should? 
What world events have nestled in your body and spawned other, tiny dream worlds, like a nest of ghostly maggots? Did you hear about it? 
Did you read about it? 
Did you sense it, predict it? 
Fear it? 
Did you do anything to stop it? 
Have you heard about it a hundred times? 
Have you read about its harmful impact then continued using it, buying it, believing it? 
Have you done anything to help? 
Have others helped you? 
Did you feel rage at their indifference? 
Do you blame them? 
Don’t you feel the same?
